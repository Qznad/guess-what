  # üõ†Ô∏è New Features & Improvements

  - Interactive Lever and Wheel : Added lever and wheel objects that players can spin or switch to trigger events such as opening doors, activating lights, or lowering bridges.
    
  - Enhanced InteractionComponent : Updated to support event triggering when levers, wheels, or switches are used ‚Äî making it easy to connect game elements dynamically.
    
  - Item Pickup System : Items can now be picked up by the player. This is the groundwork for a full inventory system planned for future updates.
    
  - Visual Feedback with Shader Outline : Implemented a pixel-perfect outline shader (from Perfect Outline Shader) that highlights items when the player is within 10 meters, improving item visibility and interaction clarity.
    
  - Dynamic Reticle Feedback :
    - Implemented dynamic reticle changes :
      - Simple dot when idle
      - Open hand when able to interact with an object
      - Holding hand when interacting or holding an object
        
  - Player Flashlight : Added a toggleable flashlight for the player, controlled with the ‚ÄúF‚Äù key for better visibility in dark areas.
